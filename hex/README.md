## 64 bits: Double-Precision Floating Point

![64 bits](img/double.png)

The standard requires a double-precision floating point number to be represented with a sign bit (S), 11 bits for the exponent of the number in base 2 with a bias of 1023 (E) and 52 bits for the fractional part of the number's mantissa in base 2 (F).



## 32 bits: Single-Precision Floating Point

The standard requires a double-precision floating point number to be represented with a sign bit (S), 8 bits for the exponent of the number in base 2 with a bias of 127 (E) and 23 bits for the fractional part of the number's mantissa in base 2 (F).

Let's consider an example: let's represent the number:
$$0.2 = \frac{1}{5}$$
